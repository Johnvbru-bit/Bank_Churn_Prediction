## Project Description: Bank Customer Churn Prediction

### Context:
In the banking industry, customer churn—when clients leave for competitors—poses a significant challenge. Understanding the factors that drive this behavior is crucial for improving services and enhancing customer retention.

### Objective:
My goal has been to develop a neural network-based classifier to predict whether customers are likely to leave the bank within the next six months. This predictive model enables the bank to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve retention strategies.

### Data Overview:
The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as Credit Score, Geography, Age, Tenure, and Account Balance, along with a target variable, "Exited," indicating whether the customer left (1) or stayed (0). By analyzing these features, we aim to gain insights that can guide strategic improvements in customer service and engagement.

This project seeks to leverage data-driven approaches to foster customer loyalty and enhance overall banking experiences.
